# Defend the Large Blue Circle from a Sizable Conglomerate of Red Circles

Author: Eric Schneider

Design: Players pull back and fling their paddle to try to destroy numerous enemies. If the enemies get too close to the center, you lose a life, and once you're out of lives, it's game over. The paddle has angular *and* linear physics.
